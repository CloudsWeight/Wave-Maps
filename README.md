# Wave Legend
A python script to scrape NDBC NOAA data for wave heights, wave periods, and eventually more.  If the waves are over 3 feet you can configure the program to send you a text message with the wave height/period.  

* Could be convenient to run as a cron job for the lazy surfer.  

Plan to develop further.

# imports

# Requires a twilio account
Just use a free twilio auth and acct id to create a working version for yourself.
